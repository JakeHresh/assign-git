What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A gitignore file is a file that helps filter out certain file changes from being staged and
committed to a local git repository. For a Java project, it should include the contents shown
in a template Java gitignore made by GitHub. This includes .class, .log, .ctxt, .mtj.tmp/,
.jar, .war, .nar, .ear, .zip, .tar.gz, .rar, and hs_err_pid crash logs. Additionally, when using
an IDE like Eclipse, you might include .project in the gitignore.
What does fast-forward in git mean?
Atlassian provides a good description of fast-foward in git.
"A fast-forward merge can occur when there is a linear path 
from the current branch tip to the target branch. Instead of “actually” 
merging the branches, all Git has to do to integrate the histories is move 
(i.e., “fast forward”) the current branch tip up to the target branch tip. "

Why should you have different branches?
You should have different branches in order to better organize the division of labor. They might
also be used to represent their own features.
